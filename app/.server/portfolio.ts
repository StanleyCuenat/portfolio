My responsibilities included designing and implementing the core platform, enhancing the admin dashboard, integrating a sleek new design, and building a custom sizing system tailored to packaging needs. I also worked on a sophisticated 3D editor to provide users with an interactive customization experience. Throughout the project, I adhered to rigorous Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices, leveraging Zustand for robust state management and maintainability.\n\nMy primary mission was to help the development team complete and release the new e-commerce application. After discovering that the entire application lacked tests, I decided, with the CTO's approval, to implement and manage a unit testing system. I also trained the development team on the TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach and how to apply it to new features.\n\nSince TDD encourages developers to adopt clean architecture principles (also known as onion architecture or hexagonal architecture), I explained these concepts to the team. After redesigning the architecture and integrating Zustand as a state manager (despite using Next.js), we were able to release new features on the front end quickly and with confidence, avoiding unexpected issues in production.\n\nOn the backend, most of the work was handled by Medusa.js, a headless e-commerce framework. While Medusa provides a stable system with extensive features for e-commerce applications, the packaging industry's unique requirements necessitated the creation and customization of certain features to better serve our users.",

    type: "Head of tech",
    work: "As Head of Tech at NomadHer, I single-handedly scaled the app from 500 to 200,000+ users, successfully managing the complexities of a rapidly growing social network. I led all aspects of development, from implementing new React Native mobile features with Firebase to migrating the backend to Nest.js, while adopting TDD and CI/CD workflows. Additionally, I refactored GCP environments, integrated Stripe and ElasticSearch, and redesigned the NoSQL database architecture.\n\nMy primary mission was to continue mobile application development. Every two weeks, I released a new version with new features and bug fixes. Since the codebase lacked unit tests, I implemented a comprehensive unit testing system. Releasing the application became increasingly challenging because it communicated directly with Firebase via the mobile SDK. To address this, my second primary objective was to build a robust backend with Nest.js to properly manage versioning and shift as much business logic as possible to the server side. The backend was developed using a TDD approach and Clean Architecture principles. As a result, it was deployed to production within two months, achieving nearly 90% code coverage.\n\nThe main database, Firestore, contained highly denormalized data. One of my key tasks was to refactor the schema, normalize critical frequently-changing data, and implement a proper backup system. Since Firestore lacked full-text search capabilities, I integrated ElasticSearch as a secondary database, enabling new features for users and providing the admin team with an efficient way to monitor KPIs.\n\nIn addition to these tasks, I developed new features, including:\n\nTravel Buddy: This feature allowed users to find and connect with other solo travelers nearby, enabling them to communicate and meet up. ElasticSearch facilitated an efficient solution for users.\n\nTravel Camp: The company organized global trips to bring the community together for activities. I implemented a comprehensive ticketing system using GCP Task Scheduler and Stripe. Since spots were limited, I integrated a timer system giving users 10 minutes to complete their payments.\n\nBeyond these features, I also:\n-  Refactored the onboarding system.\n- Enhanced the identity verification system, requiring proof of identity.\n- Created an admin dashboard for application management.\n- Reworked the feed feature, integrating ElasticSearch.\n- Sanitized and optimized the data.\n\nThrough these efforts, I significantly enhanced the app's scalability, functionality, and user experience.",

    ],
    work: "As a web developer at Innosonian, my primary responsibility was to design and develop their web application. The application connected via Bluetooth to three different types of CPR manikins and adhered to a rigorous communication protocol. One of the most significant technical challenges was ensuring the application handled data requests sent every 300ms without interruptions or delays. This required optimizing the application's architecture for real-time performance, implementing error-handling mechanisms for dropped connections, and ensuring smooth user experiences despite the inherent limitations of Web Bluetooth technology. Beyond the technical implementation, I also managed user feedback independently and developed innovative features to improve usability, such as enabling the connection of multiple manikins simultaneously. This feature allowed group training sessions, enhancing the overall value of the product for users.\n\nMy second major project was developing the online class system. This project aimed to address the needs of users who required remote communication and student assessment capabilities. I designed a system where teachers could manage connected manikins through WebRTC, allowing them to create class sessions, remotely start and stop manikins, and evaluate students in real-time using live feedback. To achieve this, I architected a solution where data from the manikins was transmitted to the web application via Web Bluetooth, processed, and then relayed back to the teacher using WebRTC. This approach ensured seamless synchronization between multiple users. One significant challenge I overcame was ensuring low-latency data transmission between manikins, the web application, and remote users, despite the complexity of combining Web Bluetooth and WebRTC technologies. Additionally, I integrated a video chat system for real-time communication, which further enhanced the systemâ€™s interactivity and usability.\n\nMy final project was developing an admin dashboard for companies using our applications. This dashboard allowed administrators to manage class sessions, users, and training types while also offering customization features for automatic certification. The diploma customization feature required implementing a dynamic template system to accommodate various client needs, enabling organizations to tailor certifications to their branding and standards. The dashboard streamlined administrative tasks, making it an essential tool for organizations relying on Innosonianâ€™s applications.",

      "I joined JobyPepper shortly before their Series A funding. The company required an additional web developer to contribute to building new features for their SaaS platform, as well as to enhance internal tools such as the admin dashboard and a KPI reporting system. One of the key challenges was integrating into an already-established product built around strict accounting rules, which required a deep understanding of the SaaS business logic and the various user flows within the system.\n\nWorking independently on the KPI dashboard presented another unique challenge. I had to fully comprehend the needs of C-level executives and design a system that displayed KPIs in the most intuitive and actionable way possible. This role required not just technical development skills but also the ability to align with the perspectives and expectations of other teams, ensuring the dashboard met cross-functional needs effectively.",

Collaborating closely with the Product Owner, I reviewed and analyzed user flows for both the job seeker and company sides of the platform. This process allowed us to identify and implement improvements to existing designs and features, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\nMy second key mission was to design and develop the KPI dashboard from start to finish, catering to both C-level executives and the sales team. The dashboard's primary purpose was to deliver daily, weekly, and monthly insights, ranging from the number of new users to revenue metrics. As this was a side project for the company, I independently handled all aspects, from initial design to final deployment. The main database was MongoDB, which required me to gain a deep understanding of its aggregation framework. By building a customizable API and modular aggregation system, I ensured the dashboard's flexibility, allowing new KPIs to be added within minutes and empowering the team with actionable, real-time insights.\n\nFinally, my last mission was to create a fully customizable form system. Since each company required different information from job seekers, I developed a form manager from scratch to meet these needs. This system allowed customers to design custom forms for job applicants, seamlessly integrated into our SaaS platform.\n\nThe customization options included all basic field typesâ€”number, string, date, and booleanâ€”with the flexibility to mark fields as optional or mandatory. This solution provided companies with the ability to tailor their application processes to their specific requirements, enhancing the platform's usability and adaptability.",
